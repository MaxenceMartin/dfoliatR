\title{Identify defoliation events in climate-corrected host series}
\usage{
id_defoliation(input_series, duration_years = 8, max_reduction = -1.28)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_series}{a data.frame with 5 columns. This was generated after running
\code{remove_climate}.}

\item{duration_years}{the minimum length of time in which the tree is considered to be in defoliation}

\item{max_reduction}{defaults to -1.28}
}
\value{
after performing runs analyses, the function adds a column to the input data.frame
that distinguished years of defoliation and the maximum defoliation year (ie. the year the
greatest negative growth departure).
