      Identifying insect defoliation and outbreak events in tree-ing growth patterns is the goal of dfoliatR.
      Two functions perform the majority of the workload. They take indexed tree-ring data and find tree-level
      defoliation events [defoliate_trees()] and then composite all trees [outbreak()] to identify
      outbreak events.

      Objects created by the two functions above can be plotted via:
