`dfoliatR` provides dendrochronologists with tools for identifying and analyzing the signatures of insect defoliators preserved in tree rings. The methods it employs closely follow (or exactly replicate) OUTBREAK, a Fortran program available from the [Dendrochronological Prorgram Library](https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/pub/dpl/). 

**Please note** This R package is under development. All functions are preliminary. Output results should be (and are being) validated with other software and analyses. Anyone applying the software does so at their own risk. However, we are open to further colaboration and contributions. Please contact the lead developer, Chris Guiterman, and fork the software to continue with development. Thank you.

To learn how to use `dfoliatR`, please visit the introduction vignette.
