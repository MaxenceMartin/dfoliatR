Description: Tools to extract, quantify, analyze, and visualize insect 
    defoliation signals preserved in tree rings. 'dfoliatR' requires 
    standardized ring-width measurements from potential insect host trees
    and an indexed tree-ring chronology form local non-host trees. It performs 
    a "correction" procedure to remove the climatic signal represented in the
    non-host chronology from the host-tree series. It then uses runs analyses
    and user-defined thresholds to identify defoliation events on individual trees.
    Site-level analyses help to determine outbreak events that synchronously 
    affect most of the trees. Functions are available for summary statistics and 
    graphics of tree- and site-level series. The basic procedures and defaults 
    follow and replicate the program OUTBREAK (Holmes and Swetnam), but 'dfoliatR'
    provides greater parameter control for the user, separation of tree and site
    level assessments of events, and built-in publication-quality graphics.
