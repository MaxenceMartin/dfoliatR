## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Shortened the package description in the DESCRIPTION file to be contemporary with similar packages. There's no "best" reference for the package methods yet, as we're currently writing a paper to fill that need.



## Test environments
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Downstream dependencies
* There are no downstream dependencies
